        React Hook Form embraces uncontrolled components and is also compatible
        with controlled components. Most UI libraries are built to support only
        controlled components, such as{" "}

        <p>
          React Hook Form has support for native form validation, which lets you
          validate inputs with your own rules. Since most of us have to build
          forms with custom designs and layouts, it is our responsibility to
          make sure those are accessible (A11y).
        </p>

        <p>
          The following code example works as intended for validation; however,
          it can be improved for accessibility.
        </p>

        <CodeArea rawData={accessibleCodeBase} />

        <p>
          The following code example is an improved version by leveraging{" "}

          It's pretty common to collect user information through different pages

          This idea here is that you can easily compose your form with inputs.

        <div className={typographyStyles.codeHeading}>
          <h2>Form</h2>

        <p>
          The <code>Form</code> component's responsibility is to inject all{" "}

        </p>

          With the <code>Form</code> component injecting{" "}

          This is one of the best features about React Hook Form: instead of
          importing components (like other libraries) to achieve this
          functionality, you can leverage your existing HTML markup. The key is
          within the <code>name</code> attribute. In React Hook Form, the{" "}
          <code>name</code> attribute represents the data structure you want to
          use.

          Imagine a scenario where you have a table of data. This table might
          contain hundreds or thousands of rows, and each row will have inputs.
          A common practice is to only render the items that are in the
          viewport, however this will cause issues as the items are removed from
          the DOM when they are out of view, and re-added. This will cause items
          to reset to their default values when they re-enter the viewport.
        </p>

        <p>
          To work around this, you can manually register the fields, and then
          programatically set the value of the field.
