        <p>
          Performance is one of the primary goals for building this custom hook.
          React Hook Form relies on uncontrolled component, hence the reason why
          the register function occurs at the ref. This approach will reduce the
          amount of re-rendering occurring due to user typing or value changing.
          Components mount to the page is much quicker as well because they are
          not controlled. For mounting speed, I have completed a quick
          comparison test which you can refer to by{" "}

            No, not out of box. but you can build a wrapper around it and use in
            your Class Component.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            You canâ€™t use Hooks inside of a class component, but you can
            definitely mix classes and function components with Hooks in a
            single tree. Whether a component is a class or a function that uses
            Hooks is an implementation detail of that component. In the longer
            term, we expect Hooks to be the primary way people write React
            components.

          React Hook Form relies on uncontrolled component. With an uncontrolled
          component, you can specify a <code>defaultValue</code> or{" "}
          <code>defaultChecked</code> to an individual field. However, the hook
          itself does provide an easier way to initialise all input values too.

          scroll into the view). The following example will show you how.

            best performance and least re-render if possible. On top of that,
            react-hook-form is built by React Hook and used as hook, which means

            Short answer: <b>Yes</b>

            React-hook-form is not recommending you to build form controlled,

            React Hook Form doesn't control your entire form and inputs, which
            is the reason why React wouldn't recognise the actual input that has
            been exchanged or swopped. As a solution, you can resolve this
            problem by giving a unique <code>key</code> prop to your input. You
            can also read more about the key props from{" "}

          <p>
            After a validation error, React Hook Form will automatically focus
            on the invalids elements of which have their proper ref, like the
            native inputs (eg: <code>{`<input />`}</code>) or some 3rd party
            Components that correctly export his ref (eg: from MUI{" "}
            <code>{`<TextField inputRef={register({required: 'Field Required'})} />`}</code>
            )
          </p>

          <p>
            However, for some 3rd party controlled Components like{" "}
            <code>{`<Autocomplete>`}</code> from MUI or <code>{`<XX>`}</code>{" "}
            from AntD) it's very difficult to predict his ref because the
            formats changes, so React Hook Form will properly detect the
            validation error but will not be able to automatically focus that
            kind of Components.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a workaround, after the validation error, you can manually focus
            on the 3rd party controlled Component (if you can get the actual
            internal input ref), for example:
          </p>
          <CodeArea rawData={focusController} />

          <p>
            If you find difficult to make the autofocus with external controlled
            component. It is possible to disable the "autofocus on error"
            feature. Maybe this behavior will bring a better user experience in
            some cases. <code>{`useForm({submitFocusError: false});`}</code>
